Program overview:
Run this program through the Main class.  Users will be directed to input the
source name of a file containing a list of unsorted numbers (1 number on each line),
as well as the file name where the output should be generated.

The program will sort this list of unsorted numbers, then sort the list of sorted numbers,
then reverse the list of numbers and sort this, reverse-sorted list of numbers. As such,
the user need only input one single list of unsorted numbers to generate the sort info
for all three versions of the number list (unsorted, sorted, and reverse-sorted).
